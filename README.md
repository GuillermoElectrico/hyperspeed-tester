# Odroid C2 Line Tester
This is a repository for a portable line tester project. All relevant information can be found in the Documentation folder.

## The Idea

To create a portable, cost effective traffic generator that can be used to perform line tests up to a
speed of 1Gbps. The solution should have a front-end that allows for the viewing of test reports and
the necessary systems in place to provide report identification.

Requirements:
  * Be cost effective.
  * Easy to use
  * Able to test speeds up to 1Gbps.
  * Provide front-end access to test reports.
  * Separate test reports per location.
  
  In terms of how it all fits together the image below should hopfully show you
