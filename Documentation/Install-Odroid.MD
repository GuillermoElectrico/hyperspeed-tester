# Installation Steps
The following contains the necessary actions to take to ensure the system functions as a whole.

## Odroid Board Installation
The necessary files and packages are included in the install script. The script is a very basic method to list the required packages and install them. It is in no way indestructible. In the event of issues the following are the package requirements for the Odroid board:

* Item 1
* Item 2

To install with the script go to the 'odroid-install_script.sh' in Installation-Scripts

	1. Copy the script to odroid borad

	2. Chmod file so that you can run it 'chmod u+x odroid-install_script.sh'

	3. Run the odroid-install_script.sh file 
	
## IPerf Server Installation
The IPerf server has a relatively small footprint in terms of required packages. The only two packages needed are the IPerf package and rssh packages.

To install with the script go to the 'insert name here.sh' in Installation-Scripts
	1. Copy the script to odroid borad

	2. Chmod file so that you can run it 'chmod u+x odroid-install_script.sh'

	3. Run the odroid-install_script.sh file
